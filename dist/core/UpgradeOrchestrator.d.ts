     * This is the primary entry point for executing an Angular upgrade. It coordinates
     * all aspects of the upgrade process including analysis, path calculation, checkpoint
     * creation, step-by-step execution, validation, and rollback on failure.
     *
     * The method follows this high-level flow:
     * 1. Analyze the current project state and dependencies
     * 2. Calculate the optimal upgrade path from current to target version
     * 3. Validate prerequisites for the entire upgrade journey
     * 4. Create initial checkpoint for rollback safety
     * 5. Execute each upgrade step sequentially with validation
     * 6. Create checkpoints at configurable intervals
     * 7. Perform final validation of the upgraded application
     * 8. Handle failures with automatic rollback if configured
     *
     * @param {UpgradeOptions} options - Configuration options for the upgrade process
     * @param {string} options.targetVersion - Target Angular version (e.g., '17', '18')
     * @param {'conservative'|'balanced'|'progressive'} options.strategy - Upgrade strategy
     * @param {'every-step'|'major-versions'|'custom'} options.checkpointFrequency - When to create checkpoints
     * @param {'basic'|'comprehensive'} options.validationLevel - Depth of validation testing
     * @param {'automatic'|'manual'|'prompt'} options.thirdPartyHandling - How to handle third-party deps
     * @param {'auto-on-failure'|'manual'|'never'} options.rollbackPolicy - Rollback behavior
